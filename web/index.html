<h2>About This Project</h2>
The <b>ucsd-psystem-os</b> project makes the source code to the UCSD
p-System version II.0 available to retro-computing fans.
<p>
This was made possible by a <a
href="http://invent.ucsd.edu/technology/cases/1995-prior/SD1991-807.shtml"
>licence granted by UCSD in 2006</a> allowing the source code to be used and
distributed without fee, for educational, research, and non-profit purposes.
<h2> How To Build </h2>
This project does more than just provide the source code.
By using tools available on the Internet the source code can be <a
href="http://ucsd-psystem-xc.sourceforge.net/" >cross compiled</a>, and the
resulting executables <a href="http://ucsd-psystem-fs.sourceforge.net/"
>loaded into disk images</a>, ready to be used with a <a
href="http://ucsd-psystem-vm.sourceforge.net/" >p-System emulator</a>.
This project wraps the necessary step with a Makefile, that does all the
work for you.
More complete instructions are available on the
<b><a href="building.html" >How To Build</a></b> web page.
<p>
This also a page of instructions for <b><a href="howto.html" >How To
Use</a></b> the operating system you see here.
<h2> License </h2>
The <a
href="http://invent.ucsd.edu/technology/cases/1995-prior/SD1991-807.shtml"
>2006 UCSD License</a>
is not an Open Source license.
You are limited with what you can do with the code.
<blockquote>
&ldquo;Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute any part of
UCSD PASCAL solely authored by UC authors before June 1, 1979 for
educational, research, and non-profit purposes, without fee, and without
a written agreement is hereby granted, provided...&rdquo;
<i>etc etc etc</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
In order to satisfy these conditions, the source files have all been modified to
include the complete UCSD License terms in a comment at the start of each file.
<p>
Because the code is not covered by an Open Source license,
it can't be hosted at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" >SourceForge</a>.
<p>
User contributions to this project are licensed using a BSD Open Source
license.  The intention is that the only limits on what you can do with
the contributed code (short of claiming it as your own work) are the
limits imposed by the <a

>2006 UCSD License</a>.

<h2>Ancient History</h2>
The UCSD P-System is a portable operating system that was popular in the
early days of personal computers, in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
<p>
Like today's Java, it was based on a &ldquo;virtual machine&rdquo; with
a standard set of low-level, machine-language-like &ldquo;p-code&rdquo;
instructions that were emulated on different hardware, including the
6502, the 8080, the Z-80, and the PDP-11.  In this way, a Pascal
compiler that emitted p-code executables could produce a program that
could be run under the P-System on an Apple II, a Xerox 820, or a DEC
PDP-11.
<p>
The most popular language for the P-System was UCSD Pascal.  In fact,
the P-System operating system itself was written in UCSD Pascal, making
the entire operating system relatively easy to port between platforms.
<p>
By writing a p-code interpreter in the platform's native assembly
language, and a few minimal hooks to operating system functions for
the file system and interacting with the user, you could move a p-code
executable from another system and run it on the new platform.  In this
way, the p-code generated on one computer could be used to bootstrap the
port of the P-System to another computer.

<h2> Archaeology </h2>
Did you ever work on a UCSD p-System?  Do you have a dusty archive of
software, dating back decades?  The system sources were passed around
quite a lot in the old days.  Do you have a copy of some of the missing
pieces?  If you do, the maintainer wants to hear from you.

>UCSD p-System File System</a>:
These tools allow you to create and manipulate UCSD p-System disk images.
You can add files to, and extract files from, UCSD p-System disk images.
You can even mount UCSD p-System disk images as Linux file systems,
with automatic transparent text format conversion in both directions.
