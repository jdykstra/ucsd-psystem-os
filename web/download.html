        If you use Ubuntu Linux, there are pre-built packages available
        for installation using the normal sudo apt-get install method,
        from this package archive (PPA).
        <p>
        Instructions are available there for how to manually add the PPA
        to your /etc/apt/sources.list file, but the following commands
        are sufficient on recent versions of Ubuntu:
        <p>
        <blockquote>
<pre>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pmiller-opensource/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ucsd-psystem-os</pre>
