NAME
        How to build ucsd-psystem-os

BEFORE YOU START
        There are a few pieces of software you may want to fetch and install
        before you proceed with your installation of the ucsd-psystem-os
        project.

        ucsd-psystem-fs (>= 1.15)
                The ucsd-psystem-fs package is used to create and manipulate
                UCSD p-System disk images.
                http://ucsd-psystem-fs.sourceforge.net/

        ucsd-psystem-vm (>= 0.11)
                The ucsd-psystem-vm package is used to interpret UCSD p-System
                codefiles, to execute the code present on UCSD p-System disk
                images.
                http://ucsd-psystem-vm.sourceforge.net/

        ucsd-psystem-xc (>= 0.8)
                The ucsd-psystem-xc package contains a cross compiler, used to
                compile UCSD Pascal source files into UCSD p-System code
                files.  It also contains a cross assembler, a linker, and
                other tools needed to build a complete UCSD p-System from
                source code.

SITE CONFIGURATION
        The ucsd-psystem-os package is configured using the configure program
        included in this distribution.

        The configure shell script attempts to guess correct values for
        various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
        creates the Makefile and lib/config.h files.  It also creates a shell
        script config.status that you can run in the future to recreate the
        current configuration.

        Normally, you just cd to the directory containing ucsd-psystem-os's
        source code and then type
                $ ./configure
                ...lots of output...
                $

        Running configure takes a few seconds.  While it is running, it prints
        some messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to see
        the messages, run configure using the -quiet option; for example,
                $ ./configure --quiet
                $

        By default, configure will arrange for the make install command to
        install the ucsd-psystem-os package's files in /usr/local/bin, and
        /usr/local/man.  There are options which allow you to control the
        placement of these files.

        --prefix=PATH
                This specifies the path prefix to be used in the installation.
                Defaults to /usr/local unless otherwise specified.

        The configure script ignores most other arguments that you give it;
        use the --help option for a complete list.

        On systems that require unusual options for compilation or linking
        that the ucsd-psystem-os package's configure script does not know
        about, you can give configure initial values for variables by setting
        them in the environment.  In Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that
        on the command line like this:
                $ CXX='g++ -traditional' LIBS=-lposix ./configure
                ...lots of output...
                $

        Here are the make variables that you might want to override with
        environment variables when running configure.

        Variable: INSTALL
                Program to use to install files.  The default is install if
                you have it, cp otherwise.

        If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, the
        maintainer encourages you to figure out how configure could check
        whether to do them, and mail diffs or instructions to the author so
        that they can be included in the next release.

BUILDING UCSD-PSYSTEM-OS
        All you should need to do is use the
                $ make
                ...lots of output...
                $
        command and wait.  When this finishes you should see a directory
        called stage1/klebsch containing several UCSD p-System disk images.

        You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source
        directory by using the
                $ make clean
                ...lots of output...
                $
        command.  To remove all of the above files, and also remove the
        Makefile and lib/config.h and config.status files, use the following
        command:
                $ make distclean
                ...lots of output...
                $

        The file etc/configure.in is used to create configure by a GNU program
        called autoconf.  You only need to know this if you want to regenerate
        configure using a newer version of autoconf.

INSTALLING UCSD-PSYSTEM-OS
        As explained in the SITE CONFIGURATION section, above, the
        ucsd-psystem-os package is installed under the /usr/local tree by
        default.  Use the --prefix=PATH option to configure if you want some
        other path.  More specific installation locations are assignable, use
        the --help option to configure for details.

        All that is required to install the ucsd-psystem-os package is to use
        the following command:
                $ make install
                ...lots of output...
                $

        Control of the directories used may be found in the first few lines of
        the Makefile file and the other files written by the configure script;
        it is best to reconfigure using the configure script, rather than
        attempting to do this by hand.

GETTING HELP
        If you need assistance with the ucsd-psystem-os package, please do not
        hesitate to contact the maintainer at
