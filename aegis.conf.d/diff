/*
 * Compare two files using GNU diff.  The -U -1 option produces an output
 * with inserts and deletes shown line, with the whole file as context.
 * This is usually superior to -c, as it shows what happened
 * more clearly (and it takes less space).  The -b option could be added
 * to compare runs of white space as equal.
 *
 * The variant of the diff_command deals with binary files.  If the diff
 * return code is greater then 1, then make sure that diff spit out the
 * 'Binary files differ message' and return 0, otherwise return 1
 *
 * This command is used by aed(1) to produce a difference listing when
 * file in the development directory was originally copied from the
 * current version in the baseline.
 *
 * All of the command substitutions described in aesub(5) are available.
 * In addition, the following substitutions are also available:
 *
 * ${ORiginal}
 *      The absolute path name of a file containing the version
 *      originally copied.  Usually in the baseline.
 * ${Input}
 *      The absolute path name of the edited version of the file.
 *      Usually in the development directory.
 * ${Output}
 *      The absolute path name of the file in which to write the
 *      difference listing.  Usually in the development directory.
 *
 * An exit status of 0 means successful, even of the files differ (and
 * they usually do).  An exit status which is non-zero means something
 * is wrong.  (So we need to massage the exit status, because diff does
 * things a little differently.)
